RSpec ships with a specialized subclass of Autotest. You can pass the --style
option to the autotest command to tell Autotest to load this subclass:

    $ autotest --style rspec2

Alternatively, you can configure your project such that this happens
automatically, in which case you can just type:

    $ autotest

Here's how:

#### rspec-2.3 and up

Add a .rspec file to the project's root directory if it's not already there.
You can use this to configure RSpec options, but you don't have to. As long as
RSpec sees this file, it will tell Autotest to use the "rspec2" style.

#### rspec-2.2 and down

Add an autotest directory to the project root, and add a file named discover.rb to
that directory with the following:

    # in ./autotest/discover.rb
    Autotest.add_discovery {"rspec2"}

NOTE that this approach will not be supported by future versions of ZenTest on
Ruby-1.9.

### `bundle exec`

By default, RSpec adds `bundle exec` to the command generated by Autotest if
there is a `Gemfile` in the project root directory.

As of rspec-core-2.5, this automatic inclusion of 'bundle exec' is deprecated.
If you want to include 'bundle exec', use Autotest's bundler plugin by adding
a .autotest file to the project root directory with the following:

  require 'autotest/bundler'

If you want to skip 'bundle exec', pass `--skip-bundler` to the `autotest`
command and it won't include `bundle exec` even if there is a `Gemfile`.

    autotest -- --skip-bundler
